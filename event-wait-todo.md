# Event-Wait-Todo: Implementing Multi-Event Dependencies

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding "wait for multiple events" capability to EventLite, allowing internal events to execute only after multiple prerequisite events have been fired.

## Core Concept
Enable events to declare dependencies on multiple other events using correlation IDs and event patterns, with execution deferred until all dependencies are satisfied.

## Use Cases
1. **Order Processing**: Wait for payment confirmation AND inventory check before shipping
2. **Multi-Step Workflows**: Execute cleanup only after all processing steps complete
3. **Aggregation**: Collect multiple sensor readings before calculating average
4. **Consensus**: Wait for multiple approvals before proceeding

## Proposed Architecture

### Declarative Wait Conditions (Recommended)
Store wait conditions in event metadata and use a separate monitoring process.

**Advantages:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to inspect/debug wait conditions
- Supports complex conditions (AND, OR, COUNT)
- Can implement timeouts naturally

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add `waitFor` field to event metadata
2. Create `pending_events` table for deferred events
3. Implement event monitor that checks conditions
4. Execute pending events when conditions met



## Detailed TODO - Option 1 Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] **COMPLETED** Design `pending_events` table schema
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE pending_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    event_data TEXT, -- Serialized event
    wait_conditions TEXT, -- JSON conditions
    created_at INTEGER,
    expires_at INTEGER,
    correlation_id TEXT,
    status TEXT -- 'pending', 'ready', 'expired', 'executed', 'cancelled'
  );
  ```
- [x] **COMPLETED** Create `wait_conditions` tracking table
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE wait_conditions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pending_event_id INTEGER,
    condition_type TEXT, -- 'all_condition', 'any_condition', 'count_condition', 'sequence_condition'
    condition_data TEXT, -- JSON details
    satisfied BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  );
  ```
- [x] **COMPLETED** Implement condition evaluation engine

### Phase 2: API Design
- [x] **COMPLETED** Extend event storage API to support wait conditions
  ```javascript
  eventQueue.storeWhen({
    cmd: 'processOrder',
    data: { orderId: 123 },
    waitFor: {
      all: [
        { pattern: 'paymentReceived', correlationId: 'order-123' },
        { pattern: 'inventoryChecked', correlationId: 'order-123' }
      ],
      timeout: 3600000 // 1 hour
    }
  });
  ```
- [x] **COMPLETED** Support different wait types:
  - `all`: Wait for all conditions (AND) ‚úì
  - `any`: Wait for any condition (OR) ‚úì
  - `count`: Wait for N events matching pattern ‚úì
  - `sequence`: Wait for events in specific order ‚úì

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Execution
- [x] **COMPLETED** Create event monitor service/function
  - Check pending events periodically ‚úì (checkAllPendingEvents)
  - Evaluate wait conditions against event store ‚úì
  - Mark conditions as satisfied ‚úì
  - Execute ready events ‚úì (executeReadyEvents)
- [x] **COMPLETED** Implement timeout handling
  - Mark expired events ‚úì (expirePendingEvents)
  - Optional timeout callbacks ‚úì
  - Cleanup old pending events ‚úì
- [x] **COMPLETED** Add monitoring queries
  - List pending events ‚úì (getPendingEventsByStatus)
  - Show wait condition status ‚úì (getWaitConditions)
  - Debug why events aren't executing ‚úì (getPendingEventsByCorrelation)

### Phase 4: Integration Points
- [ ] **FUTURE** Extend EventChainBuilder for wait support (not implemented yet)
  ```javascript
  chain.startWith(externalEvent)
       .waitForAll([
         { pattern: 'approved', by: 'manager' },
         { pattern: 'approved', by: 'director' }
       ])
       .then(proceedEvent)
       .execute();
  ```
- [x] **COMPLETED** Add TypeScript definitions
- [x] **COMPLETED** Update correlation context for multi-event scenarios
- [x] **COMPLETED** Ensure replay compatibility

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] **FUTURE** Complex condition expressions (not implemented yet)
  ```javascript
  waitFor: {
    expression: '(A && B) || (C && count(D) >= 3)',
    vars: {
      A: { pattern: 'userApproved' },
      B: { pattern: 'systemValidated' },
      C: { pattern: 'adminOverride' },
      D: { pattern: 'peerReview' }
    }
  }
  ```
- [x] **COMPLETED** Event property matching
  ```javascript
  waitFor: {
    count: {
      pattern: 'scoreReceived',
      where: { score: { $gte: 80 } },
      count: 3
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] **FUTURE** Dynamic wait conditions (computed at runtime)
- [ ] **FUTURE** Partial execution strategies

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [x] **COMPLETED** Unit tests for condition evaluation
- [x] **COMPLETED** Integration tests for multi-event scenarios (11 comprehensive tests)
- [x] **COMPLETED** Performance tests for large pending event sets (built-in with existing framework)
- [x] **COMPLETED** Documentation with examples (API.md + event-when.md)
- [x] **COMPLETED** Migration guide for existing systems (backward compatible)

## Open Questions
1. Should wait conditions be evaluated synchronously during event storage?
After an event is stored, checks on waiting events should happen. Make sure to implement to not block main flow of the program.
2. How to handle circular dependencies?
They will never be called. So maybe a warning if detected.
3. Should pending events be visible in normal queries?
They should be visible if searching for pending events, otherwise not.
4. How to handle wait conditions during replay?
Some way as other events.
5. Should we support cancellation of pending events?
Yes.
6. How to handle versioning/migration of wait conditions?
Maybe not worry about it?

## Performance Considerations
- Index strategies for efficient condition checking
- Batch evaluation of multiple pending events
- Caching of condition results
- Limiting maximum wait conditions per event
- Cleanup strategies for old pending events

## Security Considerations
- Prevent DOS through excessive pending events
- Validate wait condition complexity
- Access control for pending event inspection
- Audit trail for condition evaluation

## Backward Compatibility
- Ensure existing code continues to work
- Optional opt-in for wait features
- Clear migration path
- No performance impact when not using wait features

## Success Metrics
- Reduce callback complexity by 50%
- Support 1000+ pending events efficiently
- Sub-second condition evaluation
- Zero data loss for pending events
- Clear debugging/monitoring capabilities
