This file tracks changes made by Claude Code to the EventLite Sourcing repository.

## File Storage Manager Implementation
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Implemented comprehensive FileStorageManager utility class for handling file storage with event sourcing integration.

Added complete file storage capabilities including local filesystem backend, file metadata management with SHA-256 checksums, file versioning system, event-compatible file references for seamless integration with event sourcing, orphaned file detection and cleanup utilities, comprehensive TypeScript definitions, and practical usage examples. The implementation supports file size validation, MIME type filtering, duplicate file detection, and provides complete CRUD operations for files. Includes extensive test coverage and demonstrates integration with the existing event sourcing architecture through a working example that shows file upload/download workflows with proper event tracking.

## File Access Permissions and Retention Policies
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Enhanced FileStorageManager with comprehensive access control and retention management features.

Added file permission system with user/group-based access controls, permission expiration, and role-based file access validation. Implemented file retention policies with configurable expiration dates (1day, 7days, 30days, 1year, custom), automated cleanup of expired files, and retention policy enforcement. Enhanced database schema with additional tables for permissions tracking and backward-compatible migrations for existing installations. All features include comprehensive TypeScript definitions and maintain full integration with the existing event sourcing architecture.

## File Processing Pipeline
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Added comprehensive file processing capabilities through new FileProcessor class and integrated processing methods.

Implemented advanced file validation with MIME type detection using magic byte signatures, comprehensive security validation to detect potentially dangerous content, text extraction capabilities for multiple file formats, image processing framework with thumbnail generation support, virus scanning integration hooks, and multi-hash generation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) for integrity verification. Created batch processing operations for handling multiple files efficiently and integrated all processing capabilities seamlessly with the FileStorageManager. The system now provides complete file content analysis, security validation, and processing workflows while maintaining the event sourcing integration patterns.
