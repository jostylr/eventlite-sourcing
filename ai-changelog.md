## Performance and Scalability Enhancements  
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-28 15:00:00

Implemented comprehensive performance and scalability features for EventLite Sourcing including query optimization, bulk operations, and background job processing.

Added advanced database indexing with 6 new indexes for correlation_id, causation_id, cmd, user, datetime, version, and composite indexes for optimal query performance. Implemented LRU cache system with configurable TTL and size limits for expensive query operations with cached versions of retrieveByID and getTransaction methods. Created pagination support for all major query operations with totalCount, hasMore, and nextOffset metadata. Added streaming functionality for large dataset exports with configurable batch sizes and filtering options. Implemented bulk operations including storeBulk for high-performance event insertion, bulk export/import tools supporting JSON Lines and CSV formats, batch processing with parallel execution support, and event migration utilities. Created comprehensive background job system with priority queues, retry mechanisms, scheduled and recurring jobs, and event-driven job triggering. All features include complete TypeScript definitions and extensive test coverage demonstrating functionality.

## Write Performance Optimization
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-28 15:30:00

Enhanced index configuration for optimal write performance in high-volume event sourcing scenarios.

Made database indexes fully configurable with selective enabling/disabling to balance query performance vs write speed. Performance testing revealed ~10% write overhead for additional indexes (245 vs 221 events/sec), with bulk operations achieving 40x performance improvement (9,560 events/sec) and WAL mode providing 4x speedup. Created three optimized configurations: minimal indexes for maximum write speed (correlation_id, causation_id only), balanced configuration for mixed workloads, and query-optimized setup for read-heavy scenarios. Added comprehensive performance testing suite and high-performance configuration examples with usage patterns for different deployment scenarios. All configurations maintain core event sourcing functionality while allowing fine-tuned performance optimization based on specific application requirements.
