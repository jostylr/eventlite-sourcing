This file tracks changes made by Claude Code to the EventLite Sourcing repository.

## File Storage Manager Implementation
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Implemented comprehensive FileStorageManager utility class for handling file storage with event sourcing integration.

Added complete file storage capabilities including local filesystem backend, file metadata management with SHA-256 checksums, file versioning system, event-compatible file references for seamless integration with event sourcing, orphaned file detection and cleanup utilities, comprehensive TypeScript definitions, and practical usage examples. The implementation supports file size validation, MIME type filtering, duplicate file detection, and provides complete CRUD operations for files. Includes extensive test coverage and demonstrates integration with the existing event sourcing architecture through a working example that shows file upload/download workflows with proper event tracking.

## File Access Permissions and Retention Policies
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Enhanced FileStorageManager with comprehensive access control and retention management features.

Added file permission system with user/group-based access controls, permission expiration, and role-based file access validation. Implemented file retention policies with configurable expiration dates (1day, 7days, 30days, 1year, custom), automated cleanup of expired files, and retention policy enforcement. Enhanced database schema with additional tables for permissions tracking and backward-compatible migrations for existing installations. All features include comprehensive TypeScript definitions and maintain full integration with the existing event sourcing architecture.

## File Processing Pipeline
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Added comprehensive file processing capabilities through new FileProcessor class and integrated processing methods.

Implemented advanced file validation with MIME type detection using magic byte signatures, comprehensive security validation to detect potentially dangerous content, text extraction capabilities for multiple file formats, image processing framework with thumbnail generation support, virus scanning integration hooks, and multi-hash generation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) for integrity verification. Created batch processing operations for handling multiple files efficiently and integrated all processing capabilities seamlessly with the FileStorageManager. The system now provides complete file content analysis, security validation, and processing workflows while maintaining the event sourcing integration patterns.

## Event Relationship Querying and Visualization
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-27 01:40:20

Completed comprehensive implementation of event relationship analysis and visualization features (TODO items #10-13).

Implemented EventQueryEngine class providing advanced event relationship analysis including root event detection for finding external system triggers, enhanced child event methods for analyzing causation chains, cousin event detection for discovering related events in the same correlation group, and advanced relationship queries for measuring event depth, influence, and critical paths. Added comprehensive event visualization and reporting system generating ASCII visual trees, multi-format reports (text, JSON, markdown), and detailed metrics analysis. Created working demonstration script showcasing all features with real-world use cases for debugging, performance analysis, and data lifecycle management. All features are fully documented with TypeScript definitions and integrated with the existing event sourcing architecture.

## Comprehensive GDPR Privacy Management Implementation
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-28 11:29:15

Implemented complete GDPR compliance and privacy management ecosystem (TODO items #7-9).

Created PrivacyManager utility class with standardized GDPR helper methods including requestDataExport() for complete user data portability, requestDataDeletion() implementing crypto-shredding for secure data erasure, requestDataPortability() for machine-readable data formats, requestDataRectification() for data correction workflows, withdrawConsent() for consent management, and auditDataProcessing() for comprehensive processing activity tracking. Enhanced privacy controls include AutoDataClassifier for automated data sensitivity classification with risk scoring, ConsentManagementSystem for granular consent management with legal basis tracking, DataRetentionPolicyManager for automated retention policy enforcement, PrivacyImpactAssessment tools for DPIA compliance, and DataBreachNotificationManager for incident response workflows. Comprehensive compliance reporting system includes real-time compliance dashboard, GDPR Article 30 data processing activity logs, consent tracking and violation reporting, data subject request tracking with completion monitoring, and regulatory audit trail generation for external audits. All components integrate seamlessly with the existing event sourcing architecture, include comprehensive TypeScript definitions, and feature a complete demonstration example showcasing the entire privacy management ecosystem.
