## File Storage Manager Implementation
**Claude Sonnet 4** - 2025-06-26 19:20:33

Implemented comprehensive FileStorageManager utility class for handling file storage with event sourcing integration.

Added complete file storage capabilities including local filesystem backend, file metadata management with SHA-256 checksums, file versioning system, event-compatible file references for seamless integration with event sourcing, orphaned file detection and cleanup utilities, comprehensive TypeScript definitions, and practical usage examples. The implementation supports file size validation, MIME type filtering, duplicate file detection, and provides complete CRUD operations for files. Includes extensive test coverage and demonstrates integration with the existing event sourcing architecture through a working example that shows file upload/download workflows with proper event tracking.
